##Notes on the solution: 

###Git Commits 
All git commits follow the [Semantic Commit Message](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages) style

###Shortest path algorithm
The algorithm used for working out the shortest path [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)

###Code structure
Currently everthing as the project is very small all the logic is in the Core project. As it grows the plan is to move it to seperate projects

##How to run

As this is a incomplete solution the best way to see the code in action is to run the unit test in the UnitTest project.
